In this repo, I will introduce how to use Docker to support Python project/application development
and provide some prototypes that can be used for your development. 
Feel free to fork this repo and create your own Docker container!

## How to use this book 

Just need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and follow this book!

## Content:
- [How to set up a reproducible development environment using Docker for Python](./core/reproducible-dev-env)    
- [How to develop your Python code interactively with Docker](./core/interactively-running)    


## An hello world example

If you are new to Docker, you can follow this hello world example to have a first try.

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/ZequnZ/python-x-docker-handbook.git` 
2. Change your current directory to this repo `cd python-x-docker-handbook`
3. Build the Docker container `docker build -t py-x-docker .`  
4. Execute the container `docker run py-x-docker` 

Then you will see my welcome message.

I also use [Makefile](./Makefile) to make life easier 
so that you do not need to remember the full command:  
- Build the Docker container: `make build`  
- Execute the container: `make run`  

**That is the way to put your Python code into a Docker container**  

It is simple, isn't it? If you want to know more about how to utilize Docker to support your python development, just follow this repo and I will show more interesting use cases!
